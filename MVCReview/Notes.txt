MVC in 3 Minutes
=======================

MVC
Designed in 1970s
Widely adopted in web
ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails, Express

Model
	Application data and behavior in terms of problem domain independent of UI
		Moves
		Customer
		Rental
		Transaction
			App state and Rules

	Can take class and use them in other app
	POCOS

View
	The HTML that is sent to the user

Controller
	Responsible for handling an HTTP Request

Vidly.com
	http://vidly.com/movies
		Controller selected to handle request
			Get movies in Model and return in View

Better separation of concerns and more maintainable application

Router
	Selects the right controller to handle a request

vidly.com/movies -> Router -> Controller (MoviesController)
	Method of control is an action

An action in controller is responsible to handle a request

Plugins
	Tools - Extensions and Updates
		Online
			Visual Studio Productivity Power Tools (Extension bring in features)
			Web Essentials
			ReSharper (Optional) Highly Recommended

MVC in Action
==================

1. Create your model first, Movie for example
	just a poco, w/ no logic at first
Lets say we want to Create page - /movies/random and show movie title
2. Create controller for Movies with method called Random
	Called MoviesController
	Have Random() return View(movie);
3. Create a View in Movies directory of Views folder
	called Random
4. Write C# code via @ to display name of movie
	Need to add @model directive at top of page
		because @Model is a dynamic type and compiler needs to be
		told what type is being used
		so... @model MVCReview.Movie
		then to use in HTML @Model.Name

ASP.NET MVC Fundamentals
============================

Action Results - output of our actions
---------------------------------------
** - most commonly used
Type						Helper Method from Controller
**ViewResult						View()
PartialViewResult				PartialView()
ContentResult					Content() - simple text
**RedirectResult					Redirect() - to another route
**RedirectToRouteResult			RedirectToAction()
JsonResult						Json() - josn object
FileResult						File()
**HttpNotFoundResult				HttpNotFound() - returns 404
EmptyResult						(no helper method) if you need to return void

Action Parameters - input for our actions
--------------------------------------------

Parameter Binding

Request -> MVC Framework -> Action
	When request comes in MVC Framework automatically creates parameter objects
	for our actions.
	If action method takes a parameter, it looks for a parameter in the request data
	if so, automatically passed

Parameter Sources
	- In the URL: /movies/edit/1
	- In the query string: /movies/edit?id=1
	- In the form data: id=1

Convention Based Routes
---------------------------

Sometimes you might want to use a Custom Route like
	/movies/released/2015/04
		you can't get two parameters from the default RouteConfig
			so you have to create your own custom route
